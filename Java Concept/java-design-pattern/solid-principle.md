# SOLID Principle

Solid design principles are a set of design principles related to software design. Which were introduced by Robert C Martin, also known as Uncle Bob and Robert C.

By adhering to SOLID principle, developers can ensure that their software is modular, easy to understand, debug and refactor.

SOLID principle not only enhance code quality but also facilitate better maintenance and scalability, ultimately leading to more robust and efficient software system.

SOLID principle are jus a slection of five principles:-

1. [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://github.com/tejrana1605/java-interview-prep/tree/main/Java%20Concept/java-design-pattern/srp-principle.md#single-responsibility-principle)
2. [Open-Closed Principle (OCP)](https://github.com/tejrana1605/java-interview-prep/tree/main/Java%20Concept/java-design-pattern/ocp-principle.md#open-closed-principle)
3. [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](https://github.com/tejrana1605/java-interview-prep/tree/main/Java%20Concept/java-design-pattern/lsp-principle.md#liskov-substitution-principle)
4. [Interface segregation Principle (ISP)](https://github.com/tejrana1605/java-interview-prep/tree/main/Java%20Concept/java-design-pattern/isp-principle.md#interface-segregation-principle)
5. [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](https://github.com/tejrana1605/java-interview-prep/tree/main/Java%20Concept/java-design-pattern/dip-principle.md#dependency-inversion-principle)
