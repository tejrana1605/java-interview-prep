# 35+ Concepts Comparison

## 1) wait() Vs sleep() In Java

| wait() | sleep() |
|--------|---------|
|The thread which calls wait() method releases the lock it holds.	|The thread which calls sleep() method doesn’t release the lock it holds.|
|The thread regains the lock after other threads call either notify() or notifyAll() methods on the same lock.	| No question of regaining the lock as thread doesn’t release the lock.|
|wait() method must be called within the synchronized block.	| sleep() method can be called within or outside the synchronized block.|
|wait() method is a member of java.lang.Object class.	| sleep() method is a member of java.lang.Thread class. |
|wait() method is always called on objects.	| sleep() method is always called on threads. |
|wait() is a non-static method of Object class.	| sleep() is a static method of Thread class. |
|Waiting threads can be woken up by other threads by calling notify() or notifyAll() methods.	|Sleeping threads can not be woken up by other threads. If done so, thread will throw InterruptedException.|

But, they must have same name.|Overridden methods must have same method signature. I.e. you must not change the method name, types of arguments, number of arguments and order of arguments while overriding a super class method.|
|Overloaded methods can have same or different return types.|The return type of the overridden method must be compatible with that of super class method. That means if super class method has primitive type as its return type, then it must be overridden with same return type. If super class method has derived type as its return type then it must be overridden with same type or its sub class type.|
|Overloaded methods can have same visibility or different visibility.|While overriding a super class method either you can keep the same visibility or you can increase the visibility. But you can’t reduce it.|
|Overloaded methods can be static or not static. It does not affect the method overloading.|You can’t override a static method.|
|Binding between method call and method definition happens at compile time (Static Binding).|Binding between method call and method definition happens at run time (Dynamic Binding).|
|It shows static polymorphism.|It shows dynamic polymorphism.|
|Private methods can be overloaded.|Private methods can’t be overridden.|
|Final methods can be overloaded.|Final methods can’t be overridden.|
|For method overloading, only one class is required. I.e. Method overloading happens within a class.|For method overriding, two classes are required – super class and sub class. That means method overriding happens between two classes.|
